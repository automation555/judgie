		<li>We transfer information about you if Compulsivo or Judgie is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Compulsivo will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>

		The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  No method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, however, is 100% secure.
