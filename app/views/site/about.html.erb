	<ul>
		<li>If you've got something on your mind, and want to know what others think, ask a question.</li>
		<li>Share your questions with your friends by pointing them at your personal page:<br/><span style="font-style: italic;">www.judgie.com/users/yourusername</span></li>
		<li>If you don't have any friends, just sit back and wait for strangers to tell you what they think.</li>
		<li>If you don't have anything on your mind, why not answer other people's questions?  It's fun.  It's addictive.  Trust us.</li>
	</ul>
